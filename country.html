            Climate change disproportionately affects developing countries, which have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions 
            
            and lack the resources to adapt to its effects. Wealthier nations have better resources to mitigate the impacts, 
            
            perpetuating a cycle of unequal distribution of resources. Addressing climate inequality is crucial for environmental justice.

                Richer countries with more population tend to emit more CO2 in total. 
                China emits the most CO2 overall; 10 million metric kilotons, while countries like Somalia and Chad produce so little it's almost impossible to see.

                Compared to the previous graph this one is Per Capita which means per person so this displays a country's CO2 emissions divided by its population.
                This graph puts the previous data in perspective as we can now see that the massive CO2 emissions China produces are much lower when compared to its population.

                Because of the correlation between GDP and carbon emissions, we might expect an increase in emissions as a result of growth in developing countries. 
                Fortunately, as renewable energy sources are becoming cost-effective, future growth in developing countries may not be reliant on development in the fossil fuel industry.

                This chart shows how much the average ground temperature has increased for different countries since 1961. 
                This temperature change can seriously affect the ecological climate, agriculture, and change weather patterns.
