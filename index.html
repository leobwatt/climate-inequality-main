                Climate inequality refers to the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable communities, particularly those in developing countries and low-income groups. 
                This issue matters because it exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, as well as poses significant risks to human health, livelihoods, and the environment. 
                For instance, climate change can lead to water scarcity, natural disasters, crop failure, and displacement, all of which can further marginalize vulnerable communities. 
                Moreover, climate inequality is likely to intensify over time, with the most severe impacts affecting those who have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions. 
                If we don't take urgent action to address climate inequality, we risk perpetuating and even exacerbating these inequalities, and failing to create a more just and sustainable future for all.

                    Data is essential for understanding the unequal impact of climate change on different countries and income groups, 
                    as well as for identifying effective policies and solutions to address climate inequality.
